## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes ride booking data from Ola to understand key performance metrics such as booking trends, revenue patterns, vehicle performance, cancellations, and customer/driver ratings. The goal is to transform raw ride data into meaningful business insights using interactive visual dashboards.
The analysis is presented using a multi-page Power BI dashboard that enables easy interpretation of trends and patterns over time.

## 2. Data Source
The dataset used for this project includes ride records containing:
- Booking details  
- Vehicle types
- Customer and driver ratings
- 
## 3. Tools
- Power BI – Dashboard creation, data modeling, DAX calculations  
- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures and KPIs

## 4. Data Cleaning / Preparation
Before loading the data into Power BI, the raw dataset was cleaned in Excel:
- Checked for and removed duplicate records  
- Standardized column formats (e.g., dates, text)  
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Prepared the dataset for more efficient analysis in Power BI

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial data exploration included:
- Examining overall booking distribution  
- Identifying successful vs cancelled rides    
- Reviewing vehicle type usage patterns  
- Exploring ratings across categories  
This helped determine the structure of the visual analysis layout in Power BI.

## 6. Data Analysis
The Power BI dashboard contains five distinct pages, each highlighting a different aspect of the analysis:
Page 1-Overall Analysis
Page 2-Vehicle Type Analysis
Page 3-Revenue Analysis
Page 4-Cancellation Analysis
Page 5-Ratings Analysis

## 7. Results / Findings
The dashboard analysis revealed:
- Certain vehicle types (e.g., Prime Sedan, E-Bike) have higher total booking values  
- Cash and UPI are the dominant payment methods  
- Cancellation reasons vary considerably between customers and drivers  
- Ratings are fairly consistent but indicate areas for improvement  
- Booking volume fluctuates over the month, showing trends in demand
These insights help identify strengths and weaknesses in the business operations.

## 8. Recommendations
Based on the analysis:
- Improve driver allocation to reduce cancellations due to “driver not found”  
- Promote digital payments to increase revenue consistency  
- Focus on service quality initiatives for vehicle types with lower ratings  
- Explore time-based trends further to optimize peak demand handling
